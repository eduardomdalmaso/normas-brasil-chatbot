Introduction
Many workplaces contain spaces that are considered to be “confined” because their configurations hinder the activities
of any employees who must enter into, work in and exit from them. In many instances, employees who work in confined
spaces also face increased risk of exposure to serious physical injury from hazards such as entrapment, engulfment and
hazardous atmospheric conditions. Confinement itself may pose entrapment hazards, and work in confined spaces may
keep employees closer to hazards, such as machinery components, than they would be otherwise. For example, confine-
ment, limited access and restricted airflow can result in hazardous conditions that would not normally arise in an open
workplace. The term permit-required confined space refers to those spaces that meet the definition of a confined space
and also contain health or safety hazards, thereby requiring a permit for entry.
l A confined space has limited or restricted means of entry or exit, is large enough for an employee to enter and per-
form assigned work, and is not designed for continuous occupancy by the employee. These spaces may include, but
are not limited to, underground vaults, tanks, storage bins, pits and diked areas, vessels, and silos.
l A permit-required confined space is one that meets the definition of a confined space and has one or more of these
characteristics: 1. contains or has the potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere, 2. contains a material that has the
potential for engulfing an entrant, 3. has an internal configuration that might cause an entrant to be trapped or
asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor that slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross section,
or 4. contains any other recognized serious safety or health hazards.
Despite efforts to address the hazards of confined spaces and identify related safety/health standards which apply, inci-
dents of worker deaths continue to occur. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Publication 94-103,
Worker Death in Confined Spaces, reported the results of a study conducted on 480 worker deaths in 423 incidences that
occurred between December 1983 through September 1993. Seventy of those investiga tions involved confined spaces
where a total of 109 people died. In 25 of those incidences, there was more than one person killed. A 1986 NIOSH Alert
86-110, Request for Assistance in Preventing Occupational Fatalities in Confined Spaces, stated that people acting as res-
cuers accounted for more than 60 percent of the confined space fatalities.
OSHA estimates that about 239,000 general industry establishments employing 12 million people have confined
spaces. Approximately 1.6 million people enter confined spaces annually. Through the combined actions of academia,
industry and labor organizations applying scientific and analytical methods along with studying the best industry prac-
tices, the regulation contained in 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.146 was developed to reduce your chances of
being a victim. This standard applies to all of general industry. If employers comply with the standard, OSHA estimates
53 worker deaths, 5,000 lost-day cases and 5,700 other accidents can be avoided annually. The road to safety starts with
the evaluation of the workplace to see if there is a confined space.

Classification of a Confined Space
How Can You Identify a Confined Space?
NIOSH defines a confined space as one that, by design, has limited openings for entry and exit, unfavorable natural ven-
tilation that could contain or produce dangerous air contaminants, and is not intended for continuous employee occupancy.
Confined spaces include but are not limited to storage tanks, compartments of ships, process vessels, pits, silos, vats, wells,
sewers, digesters, degreasers, reaction vessels, boilers, ventilation and exhaust ducts, tunnels, underground utility vaults,
and pipelines. Confined spaces can be found in many industrial settings, from steel mills to paper mills, from shipyards to
farms, and from public utilities to the construction industry. The hazards associated with confined spaces can cause serious
injury and death to workers. Two major factors lead to fatal injuries in confined spaces: (1) failure to recognize and control
the hazards associated with confined spaces and (2) inadequate or incorrect emergency response. The emergency response
is usually a spontaneous reaction to an emergency situation and can lead to multiple fatalities.
Confined spaces may be classified into two categories: (1) open-topped enclosures with depths that restrict the natural
movement of air (e.g., degreasers, pits, selected types of tanks and excavations), and (2) enclosures with limited openings
for entry and exit (e.g., sewers, tanks and silo). Figure 1 illustrates examples of common types of confined spaces.

The hazards found in any confined space are determined by the material being stored or used, by the process taking
place inside the space, and by the effects of the external environment. Worker entry into confined spaces may occur dur-
ing construction activities or during frequent necessary functions such as inspection, repair or maintenance. For purpose
of discussion, hazards in confined spaces are separated into atmospheric hazards and physical hazards.
A confined space:
l has limited or restricted means of entry or exit
l is large enough for an employee to enter and perform assigned work
l is not designed for continuous occupancy
Limited Openings for Entry and Exit
Confined space openings are limited primarily by size or location. Openings are usually small in size, perhaps as small as 18
inches in diameter. An access door or portal that is too small to allow an employee to walk upright and unimpeded through it is
considered to be limited access or exit. These small openings may make it very difficult to get needed equipment in or out of
the spaces.
Confined spaces can be hazardous, and they can be hazardous in varied ways. Oftentimes the confined space will not
appear to be hazardous; it may have been entered on prior occasions without incident and may give no apparent sign of
danger. At other times there may be ready indications of danger: the distinct odor of irritating or toxic atmospheres, the
presence of arcing electrical equipment, continued mild shocks, or flowing grain or sand. By their nature, confined spaces
concentrate hazards: atmospheric hazards, in that certain gases will displace breathable air, or that the confined space will
allow the accumulation of toxic hazards or flammable or explosive atmospheres; and physical hazards, in that confined
spaces limit the ability to avoid contact with electricity, moving mechanical components or machinery, or unstable sub-
stances. Recognition of the inherent capacity of these spaces to harbor hazardous agents is a significant element in any
workplace hazard assessment. When confined spaces are recognized to be hazardous, provisions for minimizing the need
for entry and for use of appropriate work practices and equipment can be made.
Access to open-topped spaces may require the use of ladders, hoists or other devices. Escape from such areas may be
very difficult in emergency situations. Ladders and temporary, movable, spiral or articulated stairs are usually considered
limited or restricted means of egress. Fixed industrial stairs that meet OSHA standards must be considered limited or
restricted means of egress when the conditions or physical characteristics of the space, in light of the hazards present in it,
would interfere with the entrant’s ability to exit or be rescued in a hazardous condition.
A space has limited or restricted means of entry or exit if an entrant’s ability to escape in an emergency would be hin-
dered.
Not Designed for Continuous Worker Occupancy
Most confined spaces are not designed for workers to enter and work in them on a routine basis. They are designed to
store a product, to enclose materials and processes, or to transport products or substances. The distance an employee must
travel in a space such as a tunnel to reach a point of safety can be a determinant for classifying a space as a confined
space. Therefore, occasional worker entry for inspection, maintenance, repair, cleanup or similar tasks is often difficult
and dangerous due to chemical, distance or physical hazards within the space.
A confined space found in the workplace may have a combination of the above characteristics, which can complicate
working in and around these spaces, as well as hamper rescue operations during emergencies. If a survey of your working
area identifies one or more work spaces with the characteristics listed above, then please read the following informa-
tion—someday it may save your life or the life of a co-worker.
NIOSH developed a classification scheme for atmospheric hazards in confined spaces, which is based on the oxygen
content of the air, the flammability characteristics of gases or vapors, and the concentration of toxic substances that may
be present in a confined space (Table 1). Listing a particular confined space as Class A, B or C is determined by the most
hazardous condition present. The usefulness of this classification is that it provides a framework upon which recommen-
dations for work practices and rescue procedures can be made. A detailed listing of safe work practices and procedures
for confined-space work is given in the NIOSH criteria document, NIOSH Publication 80-106.

Table 1
Confined-Space Classification
How Can You Identify a Permit-Required Confined Space?
A permit-required confined space is one that meets the definition of a confined space and has one or more of these
characteristics:
l contains or has a potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere
l contains a material that has the potential for engulfing an entrant
l has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or
by a floor which slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross-section
l contains any other recognized serious safety or health hazard immediately dangerous to life and health that prevents
self-rescue
What Are the Hazards Involved in Entering and Working in Confined Spaces?
Many workplaces contain spaces configured is such a way to be considered “confined.” Confinement itself may pose
entrapment hazards. Working in a confined space may keep employees closer to hazards. For example, confinement, lim-
ited access or restricted airflow can result in hazardous conditions that would not arise in an open workplace.
Hazardous Atmospheres
Many substances have short-term exposure limits, in addition to 8-hour time weighted average exposure limits. The per-
mit-required confined space rule is intended to protect against short-term acute hazards. Exposures at or below the permissi-
ble exposure limits do not fall under the permit-required confined space rule. Other standards (see 29 CFR 1910, Subparts G
and Z) address a broader range of health and safety concerns. Any sub stance that is not capable of causing death, incapacita-
tion, impairment of ability to self-rescue, injury or acute illness due to health effects is not covered by the rule.
The atmosphere in a confined space may be extremely hazardous because of the lack of natural air movement. This char-
acteristic of confined spaces can result in: (1) oxygen-deficient, (2) flammable or (3) toxic atmospheres.
Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres
An oxygen-deficient atmosphere has less than 19.5 percent available oxygen (O2). When oxygen levels drop below 17
percent, there is increased breathing volume, accelerated heartbeat and a deterioration of night vision, which is usually not
noticeable. Oxygen atmospheres with 14 to 16 percent oxygen contribute to poor muscular coordination, rapid fatigue and
intermittent respiration. At 6 percent oxygen, there is a rapid loss of consciousness and death in minutes. (See Figure 2).

Figure 2
Oxygen Scale
Any atmosphere with less than 19.5 percent oxygen should NOT be entered without a NIOSH-approved self-contained
breathing apparatus or a NIOSH-approved supplied air breathing apparatus.
The oxygen level in a confined space can decrease because of the type of work being done, such as welding, cutting or
brazing, or it can be decreased by certain chemical reactions (rusting) or through bacterial action (fermentation).
The oxygen level is also decreased if oxygen is displaced by another gas, such as carbon dioxide, argon, helium or
nitrogen. Total displacement of oxygen by another gas, such as carbon dioxide, will result in unconsciousness, followed
by death.
Flammable Atmospheres
Flammable atmospheres generally result from evaporation of flammable liquids, by-products of chemical reactions,
enriched atmospheres or concentrations of combustible dusts. Two things make an atmosphere flammable: (1) the amount
of oxygen in air and (2) a flammable gas, vapor or dust in the proper mixture. Different gases and combustible dusts have
different flammable and explosive ranges. (See National Fire Protection Association publication 497-2012,
Recommended Practice for the Classification of Flammable Liquids, Gases, or Vapors and of Hazardous (Classified)
Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas, and National Fire Protection Association publication
499-2013, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations
for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas). When a source of ignition (for example, a sparking or electrical
tool) is introduced into a space containing a flammable atmosphere, a fire or an explosion can result. (See Figure 3.)

Figure 3
The Ignition Triangle
An oxygen-enriched atmosphere (above 23.5 percent) will cause flammable materials, such as clothing and hair, to
burn violently when ignited and may cause some nonflammable materials to ignite. Therefore, NEVER use pure oxygen
to ventilate a confined space. Ventilate with normal air.
Toxic Atmospheres
Because air cannot freely move in and out of confined spaces due to the design and configuration, the atmosphere
inside a confined space can be very different from the atmosphere outside. Deadly gases may be trapped inside, particu-
larly if the space is used to store or process chemicals or organic substances that may decompose. There may not be
enough oxygen inside the confined space to support life, or the air could be so oxygen-rich that it is likely to increase the
chance of fire or explosion if a source of ignition is present.
Toxic atmospheres can be caused by the following:
l The product stored in the space. The product may contain a toxic component, which could be absorbed into the
walls and have the potential for release depending on the use of the space.
l The type of work being performed in a confined space. Examples of such include welding, cutting, brazing, painting,
scraping, sanding and degreasing. Toxic atmospheres are generated in various processes. For example, cleaning sol-
vents are used in many industries for cleaning/degreasing. The vapors from these solvents can build up to toxic lev-
els in a confined space.
l Areas adjacent to the confined space. Toxicant produced by work near confined spaces can enter and accumulate in
confined spaces. (Figure 4 illustrates work that may go on in confined spaces.)

Examples of Work in Confined Spaces
General/Physical Hazards
In addition to the areas discussed above, evaluation of a confined space should consider the following potential haz-
ards:
Temperature Extremes
Extremely hot or cold temperatures can present problems for workers. For example, when possible, a steam tunnel
should be allowed to cool before entering.
Engulfment Hazards
Loose granular material stored in bins and hoppers, such as grain, sand, coal or similar material, can engulf and suffo-
cate a worker. The loose material can crust over, or bridge over, in a bin and break loose under the weight of a worker.
(See Figure 5.)

Noise
Noise within a confined space can be amplified because of the design and acoustic properties of the space. Excessive
noise can not only damage hearing and reduce reaction time to hazards but can also affect communication. This can cause
a shouted warning to go unheard.
Slick/Wet Surfaces
Slips and falls can occur on a wet surface, causing injury or death to workers. Spaces that have an internal configura-
tion, inwardly converging walls, or a floor that slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross-section, increase the haz-
ards of slipping and falling. Different material contained in the space may react differently in a wet environment. A wet
surface will also increase the likelihood for and effect of electric shock in areas where electrical circuits, equipment and
tools are used.
Falling Objects
Workers in confined spaces should be mindful of the possibility of falling objects, particularly in spaces that have top-
side openings for entry and where work is being done above the worker.

Requirements of the Standard
Who Is Covered?
Employers who have employees working in general industry are covered by this standard. All employers in general
industry are required to evaluate the workplace to determine if any space is a permit-required confined space. An employ-
er who finds such a space must implement the requirements of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1910.146.
General
In general, employers must evaluate the workplace to determine if spaces are permit-required confined spaces. (See
Decision Flowchart.) The survey requirement can be met through reviewing existing records and the employer’s knowl-
edge of the space, provided that the information is adequate to make the correct classification of the space.

If there are permit spaces in the workplace, the employer must inform exposed employees of the existence, location,
and danger posed by the spaces. This can be accomplished by posting danger signs or by another equally effective means.
The following language, or other similar language, would satisfy the requirements for such a sign:
Alternative methods, such as additional training, may be used where they are truly effective in warning all employees
who could reasonably be expected to enter the space. This requirement can be met in a number of ways. A space can
combine permanent closing, placing physical barriers on the space such as bolting and locking the space with supplemen-
tal training, and posting of the space. It is the employer’s obligation to ensure that alternative methods are at least as
effective as a sign. In some cases, employers may have to provide training in addition to signs, to protect employees who
do not speak English or who have difficulty understanding or interpreting signs.
If a space has a locked entry cover, panel or access door that can only be opened with special tools, signs may be
unnecessary if the employer ensures that all affected employees are informed about the space and know that it is not to be
opened without taking proper precautions, including temporary signs, to restrict unexpected or unknowing entry.
Entry Options
The employer has the options of having no entrants, using contractor entrants, using the host employer entrants, or a
combination of host and contractor entrants.
No Entrant
If an employer, after identifying a permit-required confined space at the worksite, decides that employees or contractor
employees will not enter the space, the employer must:
l take effective measures to prevent its employees from entering the permit spaces and meet other requirements of
paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (6) and (8).
Contractor Entrant
If the employer (host) arranges for employees of another employer (contractor) to perform work that involves permit
space entry, the host employer must:
l Develop a permit-required confined space program covering contractor operations.
l Inform the contractor that the workplace contains permit-required confined spaces.
l Ensure that the contractor has reviewed the host employer’s permit-required confined space program and has its own
permit-required confined space program in place prior to entry.
l Apprise the contractor of any precautions or procedures that the host employer has implemented for the protection
of employees in or near permit spaces. (At a minimum, this information must include the applicable material safety
data sheet or hazard information on the contents, coatings or liners; potential hazardous atmo spheres; sampling data
base; and residue(s) found or anticipated in the permit space. All information generated in the original evaluation of
the permit space must also be provided.)
l Coordinate entry operations with the contractor when the employer and contractor(s) will be working in or near the
permit space. (There should be absolutely no doubt by any permit space entrant, attendant and entry supervisor
regarding who the controlling employer is and whose policy and permit space practices are to be followed.)
l Debrief the contractor at the conclusion of the entry operation regarding the permit space program followed and
regarding any hazards confronted or created in permit space entry operations.

Host Employer’s Entrant
If the host employer’s employees are to enter permit spaces, the employer must develop a written permit space pro-
gram (see example programs in Appendix C to 29 CFR 1910.146), which must be made available to employees or their
representatives.
Within the program the employer has some flexibility in entering the space depending on the conditions identified.
Sometimes the employer can change a permit-required confined space to a non-permit-required confined space by use of
alternate entry procedures.
Alternate Entry Procedures
Under certain conditions, the employer may use alternate procedures for worker entry into a permit space. For example,
if employers can demonstrate with monitoring and inspection data that the only hazard is an actual or potential hazardous
atmosphere, which can be made safe for entry by the use of continuous forced air ventilation alone, they may be exempted
from some requirements, such as permits, attendants and rescue apparatus. Even in such circumstances, however, the inter-
nal atmosphere of the space must be tested first for oxygen content, second for flammable gases and vapors, and third for
potential toxic air contaminants before any employee enters.
The frequency of testing depends on the nature of the permit space and the results of the initial testing. Periodic testing
is critical to ensure the space is main
 
tained within the limits of the acceptable entry conditions. All permit space atmos-
pheres are dynamic due to variables such as temperature, pressure, physical characteristics of the hazardous substances,
and the variable efficiency of the ventilation equipment and air delivery system.
Entry under alternative means would not be accept
 
able if atmospheric hazards in the space would quickly increase if
the ventilation stopped. Sufficient time must be made available for an entrant to safely exit the space if the ventilation
stops.
The entrant or the entrant’s authorized representative must be provided the opportunity to observe all testing of the
space during the operation.
Testing the Atmosphere
As previously discussed in Part 1, the atmosphere in a confined space may be hazardous due to: (1) low oxygen levels; (2)
flammable or explosive concentrations of gases, vapors or dusts; or (3) toxic levels of gases and vapors. Therefore, the air in a
confined space must be tested first for oxygen, then for flammable or combustible gases and vapors, and then for toxic gases
and vapors.
Before the monitoring process begins, the employer must understand when an employee is considered to be exposed to
a hazardous substance. The results of air sampling and exposure monitoring that show the composition of an atmosphere
to which an employee is actually exposed (even if the employee is using a respirator) are considered an employee expo-
sure record under 29 CFR 1910.1020(c)(5). If the employer as a result of sampling does not allow entry into the confined
space, the sample would not be considered as a exposure record because no employee would have been exposed to the
atmosphere sampled.
It is important to understand that some gases and vapors are heavier than air and will settle to the bottom of a confined
space. Also, some gases are lighter than air and will be found around the top of the confined space. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to test all areas (top, middle, bottom) of a confined space with testing instruments that are calibrated in accordance
with the manufacturer’s recommendations to determine what atmospheric conditions are present (see Figure 6). (See
Appendix B to 29 CFR 1910.146, Procedures for Atmospheric Testing.)
NOTE: Some multi-atmosphere testers require a supply of oxygen to conduct tests. A test for the percentage of oxygen
is required to be conducted first.
A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 
10 

Figure 6
Testing the Atmosphere From the Outside, Top to Bottom
If testing reveals oxygen-deficiency or the presence of toxic gases or vapors, the space must be ventilated and retested
before workers enter. If ventilation is not possible and entry is necessary (for emergency rescue, for example), workers
must have appropriate respiratory protection.
Never trust your senses to determine if the air in a confined space is safe! You cannot see or smell many toxic gases
and vapors, nor can you determine the level of oxygen present.
Ventilation
Ventilation by a blower or fan may be necessary to remove harmful gases and vapors from a confined space. There are
several methods for ventilating a confined space. The method and equipment chosen are dependent upon the size and con-
figuration of the confined space openings, the gases to be exhausted (for example, are they flammable?), and the source
of makeup air.
For example, under certain conditions where flammable gases or vapors have displaced the oxygen but are too rich to
burn, forced air ventilation may create a dangerous condition by diluting them until they are within the explosive range. It
may be necessary to use inert gases (such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, etc.) to reduce flammable gases or vapors to
safe levels within the confined space. However, the space should be well-ventilated and retested before a worker may
enter.
A common method of ventilation requires a large hose, one end attached to a fan and the other lowered into a manhole
or opening. For example, a manhole would have the ventilating hose run to the bottom to blow out all harmful gases and
vapors (see Figure 7). The air intake should be placed in an area that will draw in fresh air only. An air supply taken next
to a vehicle or compressor exhaust system could draw in one hazardous gas while exhausting another. Ventilation should
be continuous where possible, because in many confined spaces the hazardous atmosphere will accumulate again when
the flow of air is stopped. Periodic testing must be conducted to ensure that the atmosphere inside the confined space is
safe. Remember that any testing information concerning the space has to be made available to the entrant or the entrant’s
authorized representative.

Respirators
Respirators are devices that protect workers from breathing unsafe levels of toxic particles, gases and vapors. Two basic
types of respirators are air-purifying, which filter dangerous substances from the air, and air-supplying, which deliver a
supply of safe breathing air from a tank or an uncontaminated area nearby. (See Figure 8.)

Selecting the proper NIOSH-approved respirator for the job, the hazard and the person is very important, as is thor-
ough training in the use and limitations of respirators. A respirator protection program is required when employees are
required to use a respirator. (See 29 CFR 1910.134, Respirator Protection Program.) Only NIOSH-approved positive pres-
sure, pressure-demand SCBAs or positive pressure, pressure-demand airline respirators with escape provisions can be
used in oxygen-deficient or unknown atmospheres.
Isolation of Energy Sources
In a confined space, it may be very hard to separate the employee from the sources of hazardous energy. The close
quarters in which the employee works increases the likelihood of the injury. The activation of electrical or mechanical
equipment and the release of material through lines connected to the confined space are major causes of injury. A lock-
out/tagout program is required. (See 29 CFR 1910.147, The Control of Hazardous Energy, and 29 CFR 1910.333(b),
Working on or near Exposed Deenergized Parts). Specific procedures to lockout/tagout specific pieces of equipment are
required before entering the space. It is essential to deenergize and lock out all electrical circuits and physically discon-
nect mechanical equipment prior to any work in the confined space. All lines must be physically disconnected, blanked
off, or isolated using a double block and bleed system. Only employees trained in lockout/tagout procedures should con-
duct lockout/tagout operations. All actions must be verified to ensure the safety of items and that they are safely placed
out of and returned to service. (See Figures 9 and 10.)

Written Program
The employer who allows employees to enter must develop and implement a written program for permit-required con-
fined spaces. (See Appendix C to 29 CFR 1910.146, Examples of Permit-Required Confined Space Programs.)
The OSHA standard requires the employer’s program to include, at a minimum:
l measures to prevent unauthorized entry
l procedures to identify and evaluate the hazards of permit spaces before employees enter
l means, procedures and practices necessary for safe permit entry operations
l provisions for providing properly maintained protective equipment, including necessary personal protective equip-
ment, to trained employees at no cost
l provisions to evaluate permit space conditions
l provisions for one attendant outside the permit space
l provisions for multiple space monitoring if one attendant is used
l procedures for designation of persons who have active roles in entry operations, their duties and how they are to be
trained
l procedures for making the rescue service or emergency team decision
l procedures for emergency rescue operation
l procedures for implementing a system for the preparation, issuance, use and cancellation of entry permits
l procedures to coordinate multiple entry operations
l procedures for permit closing at end of operations
l procedures for review of entry operation when the employer has reason to believe that measures taken under the per-
mit space program may not protect employees, and requiring program revision to correct deficiencies found to exist
before subsequent entries are authorized
l provisions for reviewing the permit space program using canceled permits within one year after each entry and to
revise the program as necessary to ensure that employees participating in entry operations are protected from permit
space hazards
Permit System
A permit, signed by the entry supervisor and verifying that pre-entry preparations have been completed and that the
space is safe to enter, must be posted at entrances or otherwise made available to entrants before they enter a permit
space. (See Appendix D to 29 CFR 1910.146, Sample Permits.)
The duration of entry permits must not exceed the time required to complete an assignment. Also, the entry supervisor
must terminate entry and cancel permits when an assignment has been completed or when conditions that are not allowed
arise. New conditions must be noted on the canceled permit and used in revising the permit space program. The standard
also requires the employer to keep all canceled entry permits for at least one year.
Entry Permits
Entry permits must include the following information:
l test results
l tester’s initials or signature
l name and signature of supervisor who authorizes entry
l name of permit space to be entered, authorized entrant(s), eligible attendants and individual(s) authorized to be entry
supervisor(s)
A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 
14 

l purpose of entry and known space hazards
l measures to be taken to isolate permit spaces and to eliminate or control space hazards, i.e., locking out or tagging of
equipment and procedures for purging, making inert, ventilating and flushing permit spaces
l name and telephone numbers of rescue and emergency services
l date and authorized duration of entry
l acceptable entry conditions
l communication procedures and equipment to maintain contact during entry
l additional permit(s), such as for hot work, that have been issued to authorize work in the permit space
l special equipment and procedures, including personal protective equipment, alarm systems and rescue equipment
l any other information needed to ensure employee safety
Training and Education
Before an initial work assignment begins, the employer must provide proper training for all employees who are required
to work in permit spaces. Upon completing this training, employers must ensure that employees have acquired the under-
standing, knowledge and skills necessary for the safe performance of their duties. Additional training is required when (1)
the job duties change, (2) there is a change in the permit space program or the permit space operation presents a new haz-
ard, and (3) when an employee’s job performance shows deficiencies. Training is also required for rescue team members,
including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first-aid training (see Emergencies). Employers must certify that training has
been accomplished.
Upon completion of training, employees must receive a certificate of training that includes the employee’s name, sig-
nature or initials of trainer(s), and dates of training. The certification must be made available for inspection by employees
and their authorized representatives.
In addition, the employer also must ensure that employees are trained in their assigned duties.
Duties
Authorized Entrant’s Duties
l know space hazards, including information on the mode of exposure (e.g., inhalation or dermal absorption), signs or
symptoms, and consequences of the exposure
l use appropriate personal protective equipment properly (e.g., face and eye protection, and other forms of barrier pro-
tection such as gloves, aprons and coveralls)
l as necessary, maintain communication (i.e., telephone, radio, visual observation) with attendants to enable the atten-
dant to monitor the entrant’s status as well as to alert the entrant to evacuate
l exit from permit space as soon as possible when ordered by an authorized person, when the entrant recognizes the
warning signs or symptoms of exposure exist, when a prohibited condition exists, or when an automatic alarm is
activated
l alert the attendant when a prohibited condition exists or when warning signs or symptoms of exposure exist
Attendant’s Duties
l remain outside permit space during entry operations unless relieved by another authorized attendant
l perform non-entry rescues when specified by employer’s rescue procedure
l know existing and potential hazards, including information on the mode of exposure, signs or symptoms, conse-
quences of the exposure, and their physiological effects
l maintain communication with and keep an accurate account of those workers entering the permit-required space
A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 
15 

l order evacuation of the permit space when a prohibited condition exists, when a worker shows signs of physiologi-
cal effects of hazard exposure, when an emergency outside the confined space exists, or when the attendant cannot
effectively and safely perform required duties
l summon rescue and other services during an emergency
l ensure that unauthorized persons stay away from permit spaces or exit immediately if they have entered the permit
space
l inform authorized entrants and entry supervisor of entry by unauthorized persons
l perform no other duties that interfere with the attendant’s primary duties
Entry Supervisor’s Duties
l know space hazards including information on the mode of exposure, signs or symptoms, and consequences of expo-
sure
l verify emergency plans and specified entry conditions such as permits, tests, procedures and equipment before
allowing entry
l ensure that determinations and supporting data from required tests are documented and are made available to each
employee who enters the permit space or that employee’s authorized representative
l ensure that the entrant or the entrant’s authorized representative are afforded the opportunity to observe any testing
of the confined space prior to and during the operation
l terminate entry and cancel permits when entry operations are completed or if a new condition exists
l take appropriate measures to remove unauthorized entrants or persons who attempt to enter
l ensure that entry operations remain consistent with the entry permit and that acceptable entry conditions are main-
tained
Rescue
On-Site Rescue
Over 50 percent of the workers who die in confined spaces are attempting to rescue other workers. Rescuers must be
trained in and follow established emergency procedures and use appropriate equipment and techniques (including life-
lines, respiratory protection and standby persons). Steps for safe rescue should be included in all confined space entry
procedures. Rescue procedures should be well planned, and drills should be frequently conducted on emergency proce-
dures. An unplanned rescue, such as when someone instinctively rushes in to help a downed co-worker, can easily result
in a double fatality or even multiple fatalities if there is more than one would-be rescuer.
Remember: An unplanned rescue could be your last.
A standby person should be assigned to remain on the outside of the confined space and be in constant contact (visual
or speech) with the workers inside. The standby person should not have any other duties but to serve as standby and know
who should be notified in case of emergency. Standby personnel should not enter a confined space until help arrives, and
then only with proper protective equipment, lifelines, and respirators (see Figure 11).
A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 
16 

Figure 11
Entry With Hoist and Standby Personnel
The employer has overall responsibility for employee safety. If an off-site rescue service is used, the employer must
verify the availability of the service each time a permit space entry is scheduled or attempted. If the off-site rescue service
indicates, for any reason, that it would be unable to respond to a rescue summons, entry shall not be authorized unless
adequate alternative rescue service is arranged.
Rescue Service Decision
The standard requires the employer to ensure that rescue service personnel are provided. The employer must decide
who is going to be the rescue team or emergency service. (See Appendix F to 29 CFR 1910.146, Rescue Team or
Emergency Service Decision.) The employer can use an outside team or a rescue service such as the fire department. In
making this rescue service decision, the employer must answer the following questions about the rescue team or service:
l What hazards will the rescuers encounter?
l Do they have the capability to recognize those hazards?
l Are they equipped to cope with those hazards?
l Do they have the capability to work near or within those hazards safely?
l Do they have the ability to respond to the different hazards?
l Can the rescue team reach the victim in time to effect a rescue?
l Has the service maintained its proficiencies?
If an outside rescue service is selected, the employer must:
l Inform the team or service of any hazards they may confront in the rescue operations.
l The team must be provided access to all permit spaces from which the rescue may be necessary. (This is done so that
the rescue team or service can develop rescue plans and practice operations.)
A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 
17 

If an employee team is selected the employer must:
l Provide affected employees with appropriate personal protective equipment.
l Train the employees so that they are proficient in the use of the PPE.
l Train the affected employees to perform assigned rescue duties.
l Ensure that at least one member of the rescue team holds current basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
certifications.
l Ensure those affected employees practice permit space rescues at least once every 12 months. (This can be done by
simulated rescue operations in which they remove dummies, mannequins or people from actual permit spaces or
from representative permit spaces.)
A new non-mandatory Appendix F, Rescue Team or Rescue Service Evaluation Criteria, was added to 29 CFR
1910.146 to assist in the selection of a rescue team or emergency service.
