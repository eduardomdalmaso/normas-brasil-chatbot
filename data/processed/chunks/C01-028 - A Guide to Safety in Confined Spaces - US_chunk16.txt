is selected, the employer must: l Inform the team or service of any hazards they may confront in the rescue operations. l The team must be provided access to all permit spaces from which the rescue may be necessary. (This is done so that the rescue team or service can develop rescue plans and practice operations.) A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces – C01-028 17 If an employee team is selected the employer must: l Provide affected employees with appropriate personal protective equipment. l Train the employees so that they are proficient in the use of the PPE. l Train the affected employees to perform assigned rescue duties. l Ensure that at least one member of the rescue team holds current basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation certifications. l Ensure those affected employees practice permit space rescues at least once every 12 months. (This can be done by simulated rescue operations in which they remove dummies, mannequins or people from actual permit spaces or from representative permit spaces.) A new non-mandatory Appendix F, Rescue Team or Rescue Service Evaluation Criteria, was added to 29 CFR 1910.146 to assist in the selection of a rescue team or emergency service.

Use the following checklist to evaluate the confined space. Yes No n n Is entry necessary? Testing Yes No n n Are the instruments used in atmospheric testing properly calibrated? n n Was the atmosphere in the confined space tested? n n Was oxygen at least 19.5 percent and not more than 23.5 percent? n n Were toxic, flammable or oxygen-displacing gases/vapors present? —Hydrogen sulfide —Carbon monoxide —Methane —Carbon dioxide —Other (list) _____________________________________________________________________________________ n n Has the authorized entrant or the entrant’s authorized representative been provided an opportunity to observe the periodic testing of the permit space? Monitoring Yes No n n Will the atmosphere in the space be monitored while work is going on? n n Will the atmosphere in the space be monitored continuously while work is going on? n n Will the atmosphere in the space be monitored periodically while work is going on? (if yes, give the interval: _____________________________________________________________________________) Remember—Atmospheric changes occur due to the work procedure or the product stored. The atmosphere may be safe when you enter, but it can change very quickly.
