INTRODUCTION As of July 1, 2011, the confined space requirements that were found in four sector-specific regulations under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) have been consolidated into the Confined Spaces Regulation (O. Reg. 632/05). The employer is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of OHSA and its regulations are complied with in the workplace. The employer must ensure that workers are protected, whether or not the confined space provisions apply. Contravention of any of the requirements of the OHSA and its regulations is an offence which carries a maximum fine of $25,000 or imprisonment for a term of not more than twelve months, or both, for a person. The maximum fine for a corporation is $500,000 per offence. 2 Confined Spaces Guideline 2. PURPOSE This guideline has been prepared to assist the workplace parties in understanding the requirements of the confined space provisions in the Confined Spaces Regulation (O. Reg. 632/05) under the OHSA. It is not intended to replace the Regulation and reference should always be made to the official version of the Regulation. In any case where the guideline may differ from the Regulation, the regulatory provisions prevail. The guideline does not prescribe how an employer must develop and implement specific components necessary for confined space entry and safe work in confined spaces in order to comply with the Regulation; however, it answers common questions about the regulatory provisions. In addition, tables of regulatory provisions are provided in each section, where applicable. It is the responsibility of the workplace parties to ensure compliance with the OHSA and its regulations. This guideline does not constitute legal advice and has no legal effect. If you require assistance with respect to the interpretation of the Regulation and its potential application in specific circumstances, please contact your legal counsel. While this guideline will also be available to Ministry of Labour (MOL) inspectors, they will apply and enforce the OHSA and its regulations based on the facts as they may find them in the workplace.
